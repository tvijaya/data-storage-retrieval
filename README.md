# data-storage-retrieval

### Note: This Project does the Climate Analysis for Honolulu, Hawaii! We first get data from csv, clean the data and then create tables using SQLAlchemy. And then analyze the data.

It has 3 parts:
1. Data Engineering :  Cleaned the data for Hawaii that is provided through two CSV files. 
2. Database Engineering : Used SQLAlchemy to model table schemas and create a sqlite database for the tables.
3. Climate Analysis and Exploration : Performed basic climate analysis and data exploration on the new weather, station tables.
